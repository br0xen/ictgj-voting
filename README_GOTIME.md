# ICT Gamejam Voting Software Go-Time README

Current Admins for the Gamejam Voting Software are:  
| Name         | devICT Slack Name    |
| ------------ | -------------------- |
| Brian Buller | @br0xen              |
| Jim Rice     | @jimrice             |
| Brian Foster | @Brian Foster        |

Generally, Brian Buller runs the voting software. In preparation for a game jam, get a couple people
in touch with him and he'll get things ready to go.  

If something is going wrong, or you're unable to get ahold of Brian (or another Admin that is able 
to get things done) just do it in a Google Form. Really, you're just counting what people like, you'll  
get by.
